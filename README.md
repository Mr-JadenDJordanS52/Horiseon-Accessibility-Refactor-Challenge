# Horiseon-Accessibility-Refactor-Challenge

## Description

This code was refactored to properly provide the correct HTML & CSS semantic structure. It was built to provide more accessibility and a proper HTML syntax for the Horiseon Business Website. The main problem this code solves is providing more accessibility to those who would not be able to read or understand the content like most; this code aims to provide some aid in fixing that.
